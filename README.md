## About the project
The poster highlights the global disparity in access to food, emphasizing the prevalence of malnutrition and hunger in certain regions, particularly Africa. It draws attention to the correlation between natural population growth and the inability to afford a healthy diet, with a focus on the severe food crisis in Africa. Despite the challenges, the poster ends on a positive note by presenting projections for a favorable trend in food production growth, indicating a potential improvement in addressing future food demands.
